*A lightweight scripting language that breathes life into your code.*

---

## üöÄ Introduction

**Oxygen** is an experimental programming language that compiles directly to C++, designed and developed by **Saad Arshad**. Inspired by the versatility of C++, Oxygen aims to make rapid prototyping and learning easier with a simplified, modernized syntax. It‚Äôs perfect for learners and tinkerers who want to bridge the gap between scripting and low-level power.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Compiles to C++:** Write Oxygen, get C++.
- **Simple Modern Syntax:** Minimal boilerplate, easy to read.
- **Ultra-Low-Level Access:** C++ blocks for ultimate control.
- **Ideal for Learning & Prototyping:** Rapidly test ideas.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nemesis2917e/Oxygen.git
    cd Oxygen
    ```
2. **Build the Compiler**
    - Follow your platform instructions to build.  
      (A prebuilt `compiler.exe` may be available in the build directory.)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Your First Oxygen Script

1. **Create an Oxygen File (`hello.oxy`):**
    ```oxygen
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    Start() {
        Print "Hello, Oxygen!"
    }
    ```

2. **Transpile to C++:**
    ```sh
    ./compiler.exe hello.oxy output.cpp
    ```

3. **Compile the C++ Output:**
    ```sh
    g++ -o output.exe output.cpp
    ```

4. **Run the Executable:**
    ```sh
    ./output.exe
    ```
    **Output:**  
    ```
    Hello, Oxygen!
    ```

## üß† Language Overview

| Feature      | Oxygen Syntax                | Output in C++                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Entry Point  | `Start() { ... }`           | `int main() { ... }`               |
| Print        | `Print "Hello!"`            | `std::cout << "Hello!" << '\n';`   |
| Comments     | `// this is a comment`      | C++-style comments                 |
| Basic Math   | `Print 4+3 + 50/2 - 5`      | `cout << 4 + 3 + 50/2 -5`          |
| Match        | `match (4 + 2) {`           |   Output : Hello Oxygen            |
|              |`5 => Print "Hello" `        |                                    |
|              |`6 => Print "Hello Oxygen" ` |                                    |
|              |`default => Print "Nothing"}`|                                    |

> More features (variables, control flow, functions) are coming soon!

## üõ°Ô∏è Code Sample

```oxygen
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


@cpp {
//Oxygen is invalid here , C++ only
cout << " Hello , C++ " ;

}


@cpp {
//Oxygen is invalid here , C++ only
cout << " Hello , Cpp block 2 " ;

}

Start() {
     
    Print "\n Oxygen Programming Language \n \n A Modernized Version of C++ \n"
    Print " Currently in Development \n"
    Print "Version 0.5 \n" 
    Print "Created by Saad Arshad \n"
Print 46 + 5 - 1 
Print 60*2 + 2



match (24 + 2) {
    24 => Print "\n Excellent! \n"
    26 => Print "\n Good! \n"
    default => Print "\n   Needs improvement. \n"
}
  

@cpp {
//Oxygen is invalid here , C++ only
cout << "Hello , C++" ;

}


}


```

**Transpiled C++ Output:**
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void oxy_cpp_block_1() {
    cout << "Hello, C++2";
}

void oxy_cpp_block_2() {
    cout << "Hello, C++";
}

int main() {
    oxy_cpp_block_1();
    oxy_cpp_block_2();

    cout << "\n Oxygen Programming Language \n\n A Modernized Version of C++ \n" << endl;
    cout << " Currently in Development \n" << endl;
    cout << "Version 0.5 \n" << endl;
    cout << "Created by Saad Arshad \n" << endl;

    // Switch/match not working yet

    return 0;
}
```
